Growtopia Crasher Tool with bots and packet spamming

# What does it do?
Well. Firstly, people were spamming packets from proxies then it's fixed with packet rate-limiting.
Then I decided to send these packets with bots and overload the server.
This client is sending packets instantly when it's connected to the server.
Please don't abuse it, I'm also not responsible with any damage of your server.
This is only for educational purposes.
